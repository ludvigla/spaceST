\title{Extract top features}
\usage{
ExtractTopFeaturesST(object, top_features = 1000, method = "poisson",
  options = "min", shared = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of class spaceST.}

\item{method}{The underlying model assumed for KL divergence measurement. Two choices considered are
"bernoulli" and "poisson". Default: poisson.}

\item{shared}{if TRUE, then we report genes that can be highly expressed in more than one cluster.
Else, we stick to only those genes that are highest expressed only in a specific cluster.}

\item{top.features}{The top features in each cluster k that are selected based on the feature's ability
to distinguish cluster k from cluster 1, â€¦, K for all cluster k < l. Default: 1000.}

\item{option}{if "min", for each cluster k, we select features that maximize the minimum KL divergence
of cluster k against all other clusters for each feature. If "max", we select features that maximize
the maximum KL divergence of cluster k against all other clusters for each feature.}
