\usage{
scatter_HE(img, limit = 0.5, rownum = 50000, show.plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{File path or list of file paths for BW image(s).}

\item{limit}{Defines cutoff on the greyscale for what to interpret as a valid coordinate.}

\item{rownum}{Number of rows in output grid, i.e. the maximum number of points to keep.}
}
\value{
Data.frame with x, y coordinates representing cell nuclei on an HE image.
